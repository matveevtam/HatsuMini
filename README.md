### TODO
- [x] Fix cyrillic layout: add missing letters and signs
- [ ] Split numbers and specials to different layers and move everything to the right hand. Layer-tap with left hand and typing non-letter stuff on the right.
- [ ] Figure out how to emulate layer-tap behavior with mouse click so that it's possible to use it for scroll and MB3
- [ ] Right thumb button on the right hand should act as MB2 when clicked shortly and CMD when held
- [ ] Improve layer switching
    - [ ] Mirror layer switch buttons on the right hand
    - [ ] Cyrillic layout should be able to switch to other layouts but with switching language at the same time
- [ ] Assign RALT as COMPOSE KEY
- [ ] Try dual behavior for thumb keys (press for key, hold for modifier): left hand space-enter-backspace, right hand mb1-mb2
- [ ] Add something to Hotkey Layer and assign switching to it
- [ ] try automouse layer (AML)
- [ ] try snipe layer
