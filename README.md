### TODO
- [x] Fix cyrillic layout: add missing letters and signs
- [x] Split numbers and specials to different layers and move everything to the right hand. Layer-tap with left hand and typing non-letter stuff on the right.
- [x] Figure out how to emulate layer-tap behavior with mouse click so that it's possible to use it for scroll and MB3
- [ ] Improve layer switching
    - [x] Implement POC for switching to Russian and from Russian to other layers - using a tap combo
    - [x] Implement POC for switching to Russian and from Russian to other layers - using hold-tap behavior
    - [ ] Cyrillic layout should be able to switch to other layouts but with switching language at the same time
    - [ ] Mirror layer switch buttons on the right hand
- [ ] Assign RALT as COMPOSE KEY
- [ ] Try dual behavior for thumb keys (press for key, hold for modifier): left hand space-enter-backspace, right hand mb1-mb2
- [ ] Add something to Hotkey Layer and assign switching to it
- [ ] Add auto-scroll: press to start scrolling, press again to stop
- [ ] Try homerow mods
- [ ] try automouse layer (AML)
- [ ] try snipe layer
